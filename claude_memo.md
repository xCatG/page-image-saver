# Page Image Saver Extension Fix Summary

## Recent Bug Fixes and Improvements

### 1. Fixed Premature Completion Notification Issue
- Modified the content script to properly handle the two-phase communication approach
- Added provisional response detection to prevent showing completion notifications too early
- Made the progress indicator more persistent by storing a global reference
- Ensured the upload completion notification only appears after all images are processed
- Added extensive logging to track the message flow between content and background scripts

### 2. Enhanced CORS Handling for Images
- Implemented a multi-stage fallback approach for loading images with different CORS modes:
  - Start with null crossOrigin (default credentials mode) to handle preloaded images
  - Fall back to crossOrigin="anonymous" if the default mode fails
  - Finally attempt with no crossorigin attribute as a last resort
- Fixed issues with preloaded images that were causing warnings like:
  - "A preload for '...' is found, but is not used because the request credentials mode does not match"
- Added more detailed debugging logs to trace CORS issues
- Enhanced error handling for image loading in both thumbnail creation and dynamic image handling

### 3. Added Duplicate Upload Prevention Across Paginated Pages
- Created a global `alreadyUploadedUrls` Set to track all URLs sent for upload in the current session
- Modified `saveImagesToStorage` to filter out previously uploaded images
- Updated `checkImagesFileSizes` to respect already uploaded images
- Added visual indicators in the UI to show previously uploaded images:
  - Green border around uploaded images
  - "Uploaded" badge in the top-left corner
- Implemented user feedback messages when selecting previously uploaded images

### 4. Fixed Tracking Pixel Error Flooding
- Added comprehensive filtering for tracking pixels and problematic images
- Implemented the `shouldSkipImage` function with pattern matching for known tracking resources
- Enhanced error handling to reduce console spam from failed image loads
- Added size-based filters to automatically skip tiny images that are likely tracking pixels

### 5. Improved Error Handling and Logging
- Added more context to log messages to make debugging easier
- Implemented consistent error handling across the extension
- Added fallback mechanisms for various error conditions
- Improved user feedback for error states

### 6. Dynamic Image Discovery Enhancements
- Enhanced the content script to detect and handle images loaded after the initial page load
- Improved network request monitoring to capture all image resources
- Implemented better deduplication of discovered image URLs

## Technical Implementation Highlights

- **Two-Phase Upload Communication**: Background script now sends a provisional response immediately, then sends a final `uploadComplete` message when all processing is done
- **Enhanced CORS Strategy**: Implemented a progressive fallback approach for image loading to handle various cross-origin scenarios
- **Session-Based Deduplication**: Tracking and visual indication of already uploaded URLs to prevent duplicates
- **Improved Error Resilience**: Better handling of network errors, CORS issues, and upload failures

## Future Improvements
1. Consider making the duplicate tracking persistent across page refreshes using session storage
2. Add more detailed statistics about upload success/failure rates
3. Further enhance CORS handling for problematic sites
4. Improve visual feedback for various upload states
